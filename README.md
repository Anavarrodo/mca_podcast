# My Project (mca_podcast)

This project was created by Ana Navarro.

## Requirements

This test consists of creating a mini-application for listening to music podcasts.
The application will only has three views:

- Main View
- Details of a podcast
- Details of a podcast episode

It is a Single Page Application, so navigation is always be performed on the client side, without completely refreshing the main document at any point. The application has a development mode in which assets are served unminimized, and another production mode.

## Technologies Used

- React.js v18.2.0
- React Router DOM v6
- Styled Components v6.0.0-rc.5
- Axios v1.4.0
- Fast XML Parser v4.2.5
- Moment.js v2.29.4
- Vite v4.3.9
- Jest v29.5.0

## Getting Started

First, install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/). Then, clone this repository to your local machine.

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### `yarn install`

Install the project dependencies.

### `yarn dev`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `yarn preview`

Runs the app in production mode.\
Open [http://localhost:4173/](http://localhost:4173/) to view it in your browser.

### `yarn cypress`

The command is used to open the Cypress graphical interface in your project. Cypress is an end-to-end (E2E) testing tool for web applications, and its graphical interface allows you to visually run and manage your tests.

To use the Cypress graphical interface, your project needs to be running locally. The Cypress interface requires your web application to be accessible via a local server in order to interact with and run tests against it.
